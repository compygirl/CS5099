/** @help constraints;modulo Description
The constraint
 
   modulo(x,y,z)

ensures that x%y=z i.e. z is the remainder of dividing x by y.
For negative values, we ensure that:

y(x/y) + x%y = x

To be fully concrete, here are some examples:

3 % 5 = 3
-3 % 5 = 2
3 % -5 = -2
-3 % -5 = -3

/** @help constraints;mod_undefzero Description
The constraint
 
   mod_undefzero(x,y,z)

is the same as mod except the constraint is always 
true when y = 0, instead of false.

This constraint exists for certain special requirements.
In general, if you are unsure what constraint to use,
then what you want is a plain mod constraint!
