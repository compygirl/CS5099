Minlib 0.1

Minlib is a small library of general utility functions. It is built
on top of both boost and C++0x, which provides much of the functionality.



Functionality:

Construct<T>(args...) : functional wrapper for construction
MakeIntList<Size> : Make a list of integers, for use in variadic templates
TypeJoin: Join types

Tuple type.

You should use 'boost::tuple' when a tuple is required, rather than
'std::tuple' or 'std::tr1::tuple'

Macros:

FUNCTION_AND_LINE(a,b) : Provide a c++ string which contains the current
                         line.

D_ASSERT(x) : A pretty-printing assert function.


*** Array functions
make_vec(T t) : Make a vector<T> containing the elements of T.
