\initial{P}eople solve a lot of decision-making problems in everyday life using the main logic of Constraint Programming without awareness of it, such as timetabling, scheduling and planning. The most popular representation of the decision-making problem in academia is a puzzle game.
This dissertation discusses in detail the design, implementation and analysis of models to solve and generate puzzles of Nonogram automatically using different approaches, such as reading white and black gridded images, random generation with any sizes and generation of instance with provided parameters from the user of the system. 
The system allows to check whether the instance of the Nonogram is solvable or not, as well as can iteratively change it to have only one valid solution. 
The system can generate different levels of difficulty of Nonogram by using conjectured algorithms that need to be assessed by computer and compared with the human players evaluations.
