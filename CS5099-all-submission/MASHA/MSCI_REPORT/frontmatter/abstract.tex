\initial{T}his report discusses in detail all the stages of design, implementation and evaluation of models that perform sentiment analysis and topic modelling on publicly available social media. The sentiment analysis model attempts to define whether a tweet has a positive or negative `mood' and expresses this `mood' as a number. The topic model was initially supposed to detect whether a tweet talks about any environmental issues that are related to the human impact on nature in urban areas (namely the Grangemouth area). Later, however, the model was changed to detecting whether a tweet talked about the UK General Election planned for June 2017 or any other election. 

This report focuses on different aspects of accessing and processing social media data, as well as using it for document classification.

The goal of this report is to evaluate the models built for the document classification, the results given by these models, as well as to discuss any possible improvements and further work in the field.
